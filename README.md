# Purpose of RBAC
- RBAC provides authorization to your Azure resources such as your storage accounts in your subscription.
- First step to access a resource, a user must authenticate against Azure AD to verify their identity.
- Second step, the user must be authorized to use a specific resource. That is where we use RBAC.
- Remember, if a user is given a role within the Suscription level, the user can access resources with the resource groups within the Sucscription.
- - Subscription Level > Resource Group Level > Resources
- By default, users do not have access to any resources, so we must assign them certain roles.

# How Azure RBAC works
- The way you control access to resources using Azure RBAC is to assign Azure roles. This is a key concept to understand â€“ it's how permissions are enforced. A role assignment consists of three elements: security principal, role definition, and scope.

# Security principal
- A security principal is an object that represents a user, group, service principal, or managed identity that is requesting access to Azure resources. You can assign a role to any of these security principals.

# What are the types of roles used for RBAC?
- Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign or degelate roles to others in Azure.
- Example: Owners of a subscription or a resource grp would be able to deploy virtual machines. Global Admins wouldn't be able to deploy unless they owners.
- Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.
- Reader Role: allows a user to read the resources but user cannot make changes to the resources.
- User Administrator Role: permission to manage user accesss to Azure resources.
- And more!

Pick and assign the <strong> <em> reader role </em> </strong> (Subscription level)

- Since User A was assigned the reader role at the Subscription level, it can only read the resources and cannot make changes to the resource or add a role assignment. <br/>
- The role will also apply to the resource groups and the resources within the subscription. 
- <strong> <em> Remember that permissions can be inherited and are limited by scope. </em> </strong>
